**Overview:**

The goal of this exercise is to evaluate your ability to develop a simple web app. This will be a time boxed code test
where you will be evaluated only on what you finish in the allocated time. We have provided the scaffolding for a basic 
angular 1.x application with passing unit and e2e tests. Spend some time to familiarize yourself with the dependencies, 
get your environment set up and ask any questions you have prior to your scheduled test. Closer to the time of your test 
you will be given a list of features that you will be asked to develop. Until then, follow the setup instructions and make 
sure everything works on your machine.


**Next Steps:**

 - Make sure you can serve the application locally.
 - Run the tests to make sure everything works on your machine.
 - Familiarize yourself with the app scaffolding and its dependencies listed in package.json.
 - 30 minutes prior to the scheduled interview you will receive an email with a list of features.
 - Read through the features ahead of time and ask any questions you may have.
 - Develop as many features as you can in the allocated time (they are prioritized so pick from the top).
 - At the end of the session, compress your project and email it to the recruiter. 


**Setup:**

Install the latest stable version of NodeJS according to the [instructions](http://nodejs.org/download/).

Install dependencies via npm from inside the root of this project with:

`npm install`


**Serve The App:**

`npm start`

Check out your [app](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.


**Run Unit Tests:**

`npm test`


**Run E2E Tests:**

`webdriver-manager update`

`webdriver-manager start` (in another terminal window)

`npm run e2e` (with the application being served locally)


**Expectations:**

We don't expect you to have library API's memorized, nor do we care how often you refer to stack overflow posts. Feel 
free to use any resources you need, any IDE you prefer and follow any development process you are comfortable with.
We do, however, request that candidates use the provided tech stack (angular 1.x, d3, karma, protractor, express), as 
it most closely aligns to the environment in which we work. No database is required (it is okay to always start with a 
clean application state with server resets). There will also be engineers available via chat to answer and questions
that come up during your testing session.
